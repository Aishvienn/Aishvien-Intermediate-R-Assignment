## Part 1: R Basics & Tidyverse Essentials
```{r}

#| warning = FALSE

#Saving the movies data set and inspecting it

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

movies <- ggplot2movies::movies

str(movies)
class(movies)
typeof(movies)

```

#Questions 3-5a
```{r}
# Creating a subset of the movies dataset called movies_final. Removed columns r1-r10

movies_final <- movies |> select(-c(r1,r2,r3,r4,r5,r6,r7,r8,r9,r10))

# Created a singular genre column, removed films from genres that it did not belong to
movies_final <- movies_final |>
  mutate(across(.cols = c(Action, Animation,Comedy,Drama,Documentary,Romance,Short),
 .fns = ~ ifelse(.x == 1, cur_column(), NA_character_)                                                   )) |>
  unite(
    col = "genre",
    c(Action, Animation, Comedy, Drama, Documentary, Romance, Short),
    sep = ", ",
    na.rm = TRUE
  )
#| you need the tiydr package to use the unite function
#| english translation of code above: take the genre columns and if the value inside the column is
#| 1 take the name of the column. Then combine multiple columns under one column called "genre" and
#| merge them into a single string

str(movies_final) # I used structure function to check if it worked, and it did!
